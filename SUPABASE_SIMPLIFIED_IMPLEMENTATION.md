## Technical Implementation

### Supabase Client Integration

All new components use the existing Supabase client configuration:
- `@/lib/supabase/client` for client-side operations
- Automatic fallback to localStorage when Supabase is unavailable
- Error handling for network issues

### Data Models

1. **Attendance Sessions**
   - `attendance_sessions` table integration
   - Session creation and management
   - Expiration handling

2. **Attendance Records**
   - `attendance_records` table integration
   - Student attendance recording
   - History retrieval

### Authentication

The system integrates with the existing simple authentication system:
- Admin login: `/simple-auth/admin/login`
- Admin registration: `/simple-auth/admin/register`
- Student login: `/simple-auth/student/login`
- Student registration: `/simple-auth/student/register`

## Benefits of the Simplified System

1. **Cleaner Code**
   - Simplified implementation with fewer dependencies
   - Easier to understand and maintain
   - Reduced complexity

2. **Full Feature Parity**
   - All original features maintained
   - Supabase integration without losing functionality
   - Seamless user experience

3. **Easy Navigation**
   - Clear dashboard/scan selection
   - Consistent UI across both modes
   - Intuitive user flow

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Existing simple system remains functional
   - Users can choose their preferred mode
   - No disruption to current workflows

## Testing Performed
