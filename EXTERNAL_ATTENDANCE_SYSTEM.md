# External Attendance System

## Overview

This document describes the new external attendance system that allows students to scan QR codes using their phone's native camera app rather than within the application interface.

## Features

### For Students
1. **Native Camera Scanning** - Scan QR codes using phone's built-in camera app
2. **Automatic Redirect** - Automatically redirected to personal dashboard after scanning
3. **Instant Attendance Recording** - Attendance recorded immediately upon scanning
4. **Performance Dashboard** - View attendance stats, grades, and performance metrics
5. **No In-App QR Scanning** - Students never need to manually scan QR codes within the app

### For Admins
1. **External QR Generation** - Generate QR codes that work with native camera apps
2. **Grading Management** - Set minimum/maximum grades and attendance requirements
3. **Live Monitoring** - Real-time attendance tracking in admin dashboard
4. **Report Export** - Export attendance reports to CSV/PDF
5. **Student Performance Tracking** - Monitor individual student progress

## Implementation Details

### QR Code Generation
When admins generate a QR code in the Supabase dashboard, the system creates a special URL that works with native camera apps:
```
http://localhost:3001/api/scan?sessionId=SESSION_ID&token=SESSION_TOKEN
```

### API Endpoint
The system uses a Next.js API route at `/api/scan` to handle:
1. **GET Requests** - Redirect students to the external attendance page
2. **POST Requests** - Record attendance data (used internally)

### External Attendance Page
The external attendance page (`/student/external-attendance`) handles:
1. Processing QR code scans from external apps
2. Recording attendance in Supabase
3. Displaying student performance stats
4. Showing attendance history

### Grading Management
The grading management system (`/admin/grading`) allows admins to:
1. Set subject-specific grading criteria
2. Define minimum/maximum grades
3. Set required attendance counts
4. View and export student reports

## User Flow

### Student Flow
1. Student receives QR code from admin (displayed on screen or shared link)
2. Student opens phone's native camera app
3. Camera detects QR code and shows "Tap to open" prompt
4. Student taps the prompt to open the link
5. Student is automatically redirected to attendance dashboard
6. Attendance is recorded instantly
7. Student sees confirmation and performance stats

### Admin Flow
1. Admin logs into Supabase dashboard
2. Admin selects subject and academic level
3. Admin generates QR code
4. Admin displays QR code on screen for students
5. Admin monitors live attendance in dashboard
6. Admin sets grading criteria in grading management
7. Admin views/export student reports

## Technical Implementation

### QR Code Structure
The QR codes contain URLs in this format:
```
[BASE_URL]/api/scan?sessionId=[SESSION_ID]&token=[SESSION_TOKEN]
```

### Session Management
- Sessions expire after 5 minutes for security
- Each session is tied to a specific subject and academic level
- Duplicate attendance prevention is implemented

### Data Storage
- Attendance records stored in Supabase `attendance_records` table
- Grading criteria stored in localStorage (can be extended to Supabase)
- Student performance stats calculated in real-time

### Security
- Session tokens prevent unauthorized attendance recording
- Student data validation ensures only enrolled students can attend
- Duplicate prevention stops students from attending multiple times

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Student Experience** - No need to open app to scan QR codes
2. **Faster Attendance** - One-tap scanning with native camera
3. **Better UX** - Students see immediate feedback and stats
4. **Admin Control** - Full grading and reporting capabilities
5. **Cross-Platform** - Works on all phones with camera apps
6. **Offline Resilience** - Core functionality works without internet after initial setup

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- Android native camera apps
- iOS native camera apps
- Various QR code scanner apps
- Different lighting conditions
- Multiple simultaneous students

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Reporting** - More detailed analytics and visualizations
2. **Notification System** - Email/SMS notifications for attendance events
3. **Advanced Grading** - Weighted grading based on different criteria
4. **Integration** - Connect with school management systems
5. **Mobile App** - Dedicated mobile app for enhanced functionality
