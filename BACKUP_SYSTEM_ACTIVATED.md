1. Login as admin at `http://localhost:3002`
2. Go to Admin Dashboard
3. Click "Backup Management" tab
4. Monitor backup status and sync data

### 🔄 Testing the System

**To test the backup:**
1. Temporarily disable Supabase (comment out credentials in `.env.local`)
2. Try recording attendance
3. Check that data appears in your Google Sheets
4. Re-enable Supabase
5. Use "Sync Backup Data" to transfer records back

### 📱 Google Sheets Structure

Your backup spreadsheet will have these sheets:
- **Attendance Records**: Main attendance data
- **Error Log**: System errors and issues
- **Sync Status**: Backup synchronization records

### 🎯 Next Steps

Your backup system is **FULLY OPERATIONAL**! 

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ System is ready to use
