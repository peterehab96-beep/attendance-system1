# Database Setup Instructions for Dr. Peter Ehab
## Supabase Project: tzljwzbliuzicobzctgi.supabase.co

### 🎯 **Important: Complete This Step to Enable Full Functionality**

Your Supabase project is now configured, but you need to set up the database schema to enable:
- ✅ Real user authentication (Google/Apple OAuth)
- ✅ Persistent attendance data
- ✅ Real-time notifications
- ✅ Grade management
- ✅ Data export functionality

---

## Step-by-Step Database Setup:

### 1. **Access Your Supabase Project**
1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project: `tzljwzbliuzicobzctgi`

### 2. **Open SQL Editor**
1. In the left sidebar, click **"SQL Editor"**
2. Click **"New query"**
3. You'll see an empty SQL editor

### 3. **Copy and Execute the Database Script**
1. Copy the entire content from the file: `supabase-setup.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL editor
3. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
4. Wait for execution to complete (should take 10-30 seconds)

### 4. **Verify Setup**
1. Go to **"Table Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. You should see these tables created:
   - `profiles` (user profiles)
   - `subjects` (course subjects)
   - `student_subjects` (enrollments)
   - `attendance_sessions` (attendance sessions)
   - `attendance_records` (attendance data)
   - `grades` (student grades)
   - `notifications` (system notifications)
   - `system_settings` (app configuration)

- ❌ Use demo mode for authentication
- ❌ Store data locally (temporary)
- ❌ Lack real-time features
- ❌ Miss advanced reporting capabilities

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you encounter any issues:

1. **SQL Execution Error**: 
   - Ensure you're in the correct project
   - Copy the script exactly as provided
   - Check that your account has admin permissions

2. **Table Not Created**:
   - Refresh the Table Editor page
   - Check the SQL Editor for error messages
   - Verify the script ran completely

3. **Authentication Still Not Working**:
   - Restart your development server
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser console for errors

## 🎉 **After Setup - Test Your System**

1. **Restart Development Server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Authentication**:
   - Visit: http://localhost:3003
   - Try Google OAuth - should work without "service unavailable" error
   - Try biometric authentication if your device supports it

3. **Test Attendance**:
   - Generate QR codes
   - Scan attendance
   - Check real-time notifications
   - Review admin dashboard data
