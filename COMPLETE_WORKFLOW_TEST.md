## 🔍 DEBUGGING CHECKS

### Console Verification
Open browser console (F12) and check for these messages:

**During Registration**:
- ✅ `[Student Auth] Registration successful`
- ✅ `Student profile saved to Supabase with subjects`

**During QR Scanning**:
- ✅ `[QR Scanner] Using real QR data from active session`
- ✅ `Attendance synced to Supabase successfully`
- ✅ `Grade record synced to Supabase successfully`

**During Login**:
- ✅ `[Student Auth] Loaded subjects from Supabase`
- ✅ `Student logged in successfully with subjects`

### Supabase Database Check (if configured)
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Table Editor
2. **Check `profiles` table**:
   - ✅ Student record exists with subjects array
3. **Check `attendance_records` table**:
   - ✅ Attendance record exists with correct student_id and session_id
4. **Check `grades` table**:
   - ✅ Grade record exists with attendance_score = 10

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: \"No active session found\"
**Solution**: Admin must generate QR code first in Tab 1

### Issue: \"Subject mismatch\"
**Solution**: Student must select exact same subject as admin's QR code

### Issue: \"QR code has expired\"
**Solution**: QR codes expire after 30 minutes. Generate new QR code.

### Issue: Registration fails
**Solutions**:
- Check email format is valid
- Ensure password is strong enough
- Select at least one subject
- Check browser console for detailed errors

### Issue: \"Failed to sync to Supabase\"
**Solutions**:
1. Check `.env.local` has real Supabase credentials (not placeholders)
2. Check network tab for Supabase API calls
3. Verify Supabase project is active
4. System still works in demo mode even if Supabase fails
