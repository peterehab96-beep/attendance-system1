# Simple Authentication System

## Overview
This document describes the simplified authentication system for the simple QR attendance system. It provides a lightweight, client-side authentication mechanism for both administrators and students, similar to the original system but with reduced complexity.

## System Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. Users access the simple authentication entry point at [/simple-auth](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/page.tsx)
2. Users select their role (Admin or Student)
3. Users can either register for a new account or log in to an existing account
4. Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to their respective dashboards

### Data Storage
All user data is stored in the browser's localStorage:
- User accounts: `simple_users`
- Current admin session: `current_simple_admin`
- Current student session: `current_simple_student`

## Components

### Authentication Entry Point ([/simple-auth](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/page.tsx))
- Role selection interface for admin and student
- Links to registration and login pages for both roles

### Admin Authentication
#### Login ([/simple-auth/admin/login](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/admin/login/page.tsx))
- Email and password authentication
- Validation of credentials against stored users
- Redirect to admin dashboard upon successful login

#### Registration ([/simple-auth/admin/register](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/admin/register/page.tsx))
- Name, email, and password registration
- Password confirmation validation
- Duplicate email checking
- Redirect to admin dashboard upon successful registration

### Student Authentication
#### Login ([/simple-auth/student/login](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/student/login/page.tsx))
- Email and password authentication
- Validation of credentials against stored users
- Redirect to student scanner upon successful login

#### Registration ([/simple-auth/student/register](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/student/register/page.tsx))
- Name, email, and password registration
- Academic level selection
- Subject enrollment (based on academic level)
- Password confirmation validation
- Duplicate email checking
- Redirect to student scanner upon successful registration

## User Data Structure

### Admin User
```typescript
interface AdminUser {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  password: string
  role: "admin"
}
```

### Student User
```typescript
interface StudentUser {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  password: string
  role: "student"
  academicLevel: string
  subjects: string[]
}
```

## Dashboard Integration

### Simple Admin Dashboard ([/admin/simple-dashboard](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/admin/simple-dashboard/page.tsx))
- Checks for authenticated admin session on load
- Redirects to login page if no session found
- Displays admin information and logout button

### Simple Student Scanner ([/student/simple-scan](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/student/simple-scan/page.tsx))
- Checks for authenticated student session on load
- Redirects to login page if no session found
- Displays student information and logout button

## Security Considerations

### Password Storage
- Passwords are stored in plain text in localStorage (for demonstration purposes only)
- In a production environment, passwords should be properly hashed

### Session Management
- Sessions are maintained using localStorage
- No server-side session validation
- Sessions persist until explicit logout

### Data Isolation
- Admin and student data are stored separately
- Users can only access their respective dashboards
- Subject validation ensures students can only mark attendance for enrolled subjects

## Access Points

### Authentication System
- Entry Point: [/simple-auth](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/page.tsx)
- Admin Login: [/simple-auth/admin/login](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/admin/login/page.tsx)
- Admin Register: [/simple-auth/admin/register](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/admin/register/page.tsx)
- Student Login: [/simple-auth/student/login](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/student/login/page.tsx)
- Student Register: [/simple-auth/student/register](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/simple-auth/student/register/page.tsx)

### Dashboards
- Admin Dashboard: [/admin/simple-dashboard](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/admin/simple-dashboard/page.tsx)
- Student Scanner: [/student/simple-scan](file:///c:/Users/Dr.%20Peter%20Ehab/Downloads/attendance-system/app/student/simple-scan/page.tsx)

## Features

### Admin Features
